# node-js-authentication
 #frontend 
 vite-react js-used 
 components used for login,signup,dashboard,home.

 #backend 

 components installed:
 express,mongoose, json web token,cookie-parser,cors,bcryptjs,nodemon.nanaoid

 cookie-parser for getting cookies values,
 bcryptjs to decrypt the value,
 json web token to enter the token for authentication,nanaoid for short url

 cors for middleware access,mongoose to connect to mongodb used model for entering database details use schema is well in the code


 I have used boostrap also for styling the front end components

 when we try to logged in as new user it show as invalid creditials in the console.when we register as a new user it will direct to the login page when logged in and it will go to the dashboard page.
 I have used many hooks like usestate,useeffect,usenavigate etc.I have used axios and methods like get post etc,for geeting api from backend and when we logged in the details should go to the mongodb database.alongside this code I have used url shorten code also.
 The main objective of this project is authentication for users.
